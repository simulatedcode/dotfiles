We acknowledge that our interactions online have real-world impacts and strive to use the internet with awareness and integrity.

## Our Principles

1. **Respect & Kindness** – Treat others with respect and kindness in all interactions. Avoid harmful language, personal attacks, and inflammatory behavior.
2. **Privacy Awareness** – Respect the privacy of others. Do not share personal or sensitive information without consent.
3. **Fact-Checking & Misinformation** – Be mindful of the accuracy of information shared. Verify sources before spreading information.
4. **Constructive Engagement** – Encourage open discussions but remain civil and considerate, even in disagreement.
5. **Security Consciousness** – Be aware of online security practices. Avoid sharing insecure links or engaging in suspicious activities.
6. **Attribution & Fair Use** – Credit original creators when sharing or modifying content. Do not plagiarize or claim others' work as your own.
